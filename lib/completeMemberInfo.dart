/*
Plese go though the "Contributors.md" file before you start coding or editing.

However the guidelines are as follows:
1) This is the only file which you need to edit to contribute in the development. However, you can always look at other files in the codebase incase you are inquisitive enough.

2)Now, What to edit in this file?
All you need is to create one more member object below within the list _members and provide all the details about yourself. Also, before this make sure your profile picture is in the assets/profile folder. 

The fields in the member class are:

Department=your department of graduation
ProfilePic=path to your profile photo
AboutMe= A brief introduction about yourself
faceboobUrl=your facebook account url
GithubURl=your github account url
LinkedInURl=your linkedIn account url
Status= A 2-3 word technical expertise

Remember all are string input.
I have already added my info. I have also added info of other developers for demonstration purpose.In same manner you need to add yours.

If you don't have url for the fb ,github & linkedIn, just remove that field.
